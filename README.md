# JMupen
JMupen is a Java GUI for Mupen64plus (N64 Emulator), it is multiplatform (so it will run on Windows, Mac and Linux).

Latest version is hosted under http://xela92.linuxzogno.org/JMupen and is named JMupen.jar (you can also find it under exe folder in this source) 

This software includes binaries from https://github.com/mupen64plus/mupen64plus-core/releases/tag/2.5 and from http://www.mupen64plus.org/old-releases/

It is a just-for-fun project, so I can't guarantee support. In case of problems, submit me an issue and I will fix it when possible, if possible.

If you don't mind sources, go to exe directory and grab JMupen.jar. To run it, just double-click on it. If it's not working, please install Java 8 ( www.java.com ).

Linux Users:  if it's not working please resolve dependencies. You need to install sdl(1.2), libpng14, freetype, zlib, (lib)glu, libboost.
If you use Archlinux, under src/bin_legacy/lin/lib/ (in jar file or in these sources) you can find a script named "jmupen_deps_arch.sh". If you run it in that folder, it'll solve dependencies for you (needs to be tested).

# USAGE

As it is Mupen, when you're in game commands are the same of Mupen64plus.
