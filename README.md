# JMupen
Java GUI for Mupen64plus (N64 Emulator)

This software includes binaries from https://github.com/mupen64plus/mupen64plus-core/releases/tag/2.5 and from http://www.mupen64plus.org/old-releases/

It is a just-for-fun project, so I can't guarantee support. In case of problems, submit me an issue and I will fix it when possible, if possible.

If you don't mind sources, go to exe directory and grab JMupen.jar. To run it, just double-click on it. If it's not working, please install Java 8 ( www.java.com ).
